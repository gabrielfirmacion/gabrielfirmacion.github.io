  <h2>My feelings entering DBC</h2>
  <h4>June 13, 2015</h4>
    <p>
        Weeks prior to entering phase 0, I always had this fear that I am not ready or skilled to start this journey. I did not take any computer classes when I was in college and I was never really accustomed into using a mac. I recently just started to use one about 2 months ago because I knew I had to get used to it and up to know I am not an expert in using a mac. These factors made me doubt if I was ready to take on the bootcamp. That feeling became worse when day 1 of phase 0 happened. The curriculum was released and students were asking smart questions that I did not even understand what they were trying to say.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, going through the challenges made me feel more confident because I was not encountering any major issues and it looked like I was doing everything right that was asked of me in the challenge. I was not sure if I was able to absorb the challenges better than others or I just knew how to follow instructions and was lucky enough not to encounter any issues. My fear was still there but it made me feel more confident that I was able to do the challenges correctly. All the video blogs that DBC showed and explained that students will have that feeling of fear all came true for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moving forward with what I expect from DBC, I know that this will become one roller coaster ride. I will experience a lot of highs and lows. Every challenge will become harder and harder but the victory of overcoming those challenges will become sweeter and sweeter. I know that this will be one tough ride with having very short breaks to have fun with family and friends. That 9 week ride, my life will mostly be about just coding and I going to face that challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an employee, I know that in order to become a great employee, you should know how to work well with others and I embrace that culture that DBC brings. I sometimes see myself as a shy person and I always get this nervous feeling meeting someone the first time when it is about work but I have to face that fear and develop my social skills because I know that will teach me to be a better worker and a better person.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am very excited to experience this awesome phase of my life but at the same time I am scared (scared + awesome = Scawesome, yup that is the title) because what if I get kicked out, what if I become the most ignorant in our cohort, and what if I am dragging my pair down? All these fears, I just have to face and put in all the effort to make sure that my fears don't become a reality. This bootcamp is a journey that hopefully becomes a part of the rest of my life as I try to start a new career path for myself.
