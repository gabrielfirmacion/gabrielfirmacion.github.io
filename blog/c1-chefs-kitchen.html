  <h2>My feelings entering DBC</h2>
  <h4>June 13, 2015</h4>
    <p>
        Weeks prior to entering phase 0, I always had this fear that I am not ready or skilled to start this journey. I did not take any computer classes when I was in college and I was never really accustomed into using a mac. I recently just started to use one about 2 months ago because I knew I had to get used to it and up to know I am not an expert in using a mac. These factors made me doubt if I was ready to take on the bootcamp. That feeling became worse when day 1 of phase 0 happened. The curriculum was released and students were asking smart questions that I did not even understand what they were trying to say.

        However, going through the challenges made me feel more confident because I was not encountering any major issues and it looked like I was doing everything right that was asked of me in the challenge. I was not sure if I was able to absorb the challenges better than others or I just knew how to follow instructions and was lucky enough not to encounter any issues. My fear was still there but it made me feel more confident that I was able to do the challenges correctly. All the video blogs that DBC showed and explained that students will have that feeling of fear all came true for me.

        Moving forward with what I expect from DBC, I know that this will become one roller coaster ride. I will experience a lot of highs and lows. Every challenge will become harder and harder but the victory of overcoming those challenges will become sweeter and sweeter. I know that this will be one tough ride with having very short breaks to have fun with family and friends. That 9 week ride, my life will mostly be about just coding and I going to face that challenge.

      As an employee, I know that in order to become a great employee, you should know how to work well with others and I embrace that culture that DBC brings. I sometimes see myself as a shy person and I always get this nervous feeling meeting someone the first time when it is about work but I have to face that fear and develop my social skills because I know that will teach me to be a better worker and a better person.

      I am very excited to experience this awesome phase of my life but at the same time I am scared (scared + awesome = Scawesome, yup that is the title) because what if I get kicked out, what if I become the most ignorant in our cohort, and what if I am dragging my pair down? All these fears, I just have to face and put in all the effort to make sure that my fears don't become a reality. This bootcamp is a journey that hopefully becomes a part of the rest of my life as I try to start a new career path for myself.
