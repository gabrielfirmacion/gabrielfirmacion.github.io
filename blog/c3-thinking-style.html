    <p>
      Before Dev Bootcamp, I never really thought what type of thinking style I had. I just knew that I wanted every to be in order or done in an orderly fashion. I never liked jumping from one task to another without really organizing what should be done first.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I took the Personal Thinking style quiz, I learned I was an Abstract Sequential. Here are the top 3 true facts that I know I am as a person that was under Abstract Sequential.<br/>
    1. I want my point to be heard.<br/>
    2. I want that I have the option to work as a group or alone.<br/>
    3. Do things in an orderly manner.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      All these 3 facts both have advantages and disadvantages. Most of the time, my point is very relevant to what our group is discussing but there are times that when others say I am wrong when I feel I am right, I find it very hard to swallow that my point or decision is not followed. There are tasks wherein I know I can do something better when I just do it alone because that way I get to do all the decisions and I can do it in my own way. However, there are also a lot of times wherein I get stuck or I do not know what to do anymore that I wish I just worked in a group. Doing things in an orderly manner was actually very good for me in terms of following instructions and doing challenges correctly in DBC. However, in a pairing session, when my pair wants to jump from one task to another, I find it hard and very irritating that our tasks are not organized.

    </p>
    <p>
      For my thinking style, I know that I should keep the advantages because I benefit a lot from them and I should learn to turn the disadvantages to strengths. Learning styles can still be changed for the better just as long as I have a growth mindset. I know that I can still learn not only how to program, but how to adjust to other people as well. Working in pairs and groups will enable me to practice my social skills and my ability to work well with others. In time, I know I will be able to accept the fact that things can be done the right way in multiple ways and not just my way.
