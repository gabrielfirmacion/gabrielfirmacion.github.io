  <h1>Biggest Problem in the Tech Industry</h1>

  <section>
  <h2>Calling all the women</h2>
  <h4>July 11, 2015</h4>

    When I googled ‘Problems in the tech industry’, I just clicked on the first two links. Both of the links were articles explaining why women is underrepresented in the tech industry. Before making this blog, I knew that the tech industry was dominated by men but I did not know how grave the dominance was. Did you know that only 15% of the workforce in Yahoo and 17% of the workforce in Google are women?

    Apparently, a lot of men in the tech industry still do not treat women equally or at least with respect. According to the articles that I read, there have been a lot of instances of inappropriate behaviour and that women are seen or treated as sex objects. The article even mentioned that there have been some cases wherein male colleagues created pornographic products just to embarrass women. Those guys probably never got to interact with women in high school. At the 2013 TechCrunch conference in San Francisco, one group even happily showcased their app ‘TITStare’. I was so surprised when I read about this. It is so ironic that the most advanced industry is so outdated when it comes to treating women.

    When I first applied to bootcamps, I realised that there are discounts if you were female. Discounts ranged from $500-$1000. These were good incentives to attract women into going into bootcamps but these are probably not enough. Attracting women in the tech industry should happen in college, universities should offer big discounts to women who take up a tech related field. One solution I also thought of was maybe computer manufacturers can offer discounts as well to females who are currently taking up a tech related major. However, at the same time, these solutions are happening, the problems in the current work environment should be fixed as well. Leaders should be strict in enforcing their rules about sexual harassment whether it be in the office or in a  conference.

    This current problem may be hard to change but it is changeable. People who get hired in the tech industry should be mature enough to work there and give their best effort to change the work environment. A balance between both genders will be the best for the industry because I believe that men and women think differently and if we put both perspectives into place, we are able to build better technology for the future.
