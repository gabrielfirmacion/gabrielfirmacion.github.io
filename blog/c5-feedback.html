  <h2>Making me a better person with feedback</h2>
  <h4>July 17, 2015</h4>
    <p>
      I remember my very first pairing session made me feel nervous. I knew there was no reason to be nervous about since we were both learning but most probably because of the fact that it was the first. After that, I got more comfortable sharing everything I know or did not know about the topic to my partner. Pairing sessions are very important and beneficial to our learning. In my blog, I will share you my thoughts and experiences on how to make an effective pairing session.

    <p>
      In order to make the session effective, you have to share your knowledge and show your ignorance. I like this part of DBC that they make us pair 3 times a week. I learn a lot from my pair because I can see how they approach the problem. Sometimes their approach is better than what I did and if I think it is not, I make suggestions. And of course,  you always have to be open to other people’s advice, thoughts, and opinions on how to solve the problem. If you don’t take them into consideration, besides the fact that they would want to end the session as soon as possible, you will not learn how to be a team player.

      The worst feeling in a pairing session is being stuck and both of you are clueless on what is wrong. This happened to me a few times and I hate the feeling. If you have already spent a good 15-20 minutes researching and still could not fix the problem, end the session, take a break, and then try to solve it in your own. I know I am able to concentrate more when I work alone. There are less distractions and you get to try all the methods you want to experiment on without worrying that you are wasting someone’s time. So there are times that I was able to solve the problem after the session ended and I would just share my solution to my partner via email. So when this happens, do not be afraid to suggest to your partner to take a break.

      After a pairing session, each person is tasked to write a feedback to someone. This feedback should be KIND, SPECIFIC, and ACTIONABLE. This type of feedback would do justice if you feel good about the feedback because you know how to get better in pairing. It was wrote in a way that is not hurtful to read and contained constructive criticism. In my opinion, the most important part is that it should be actionable because it teaches you how to be a better pair next time around. It contains actions on what you should start or stop doing while pairing.

      I am proud to say that most of my feedback that I got are positive which means people like pairing with me but of course I also had my down times wherein the connection between my pair and I was not just there and because of that, my pair gave me a lot of criticism. I felt bad at first, but I knew that my pair wrote that to make me a better pair for the next person I pair with and a better programmer as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      So every time you read a feedback, read each criticism as an advice or opinion and know that they are trying to make you a better student.
