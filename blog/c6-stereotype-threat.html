  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>

Stereotyping has been a problem in the world for centuries. As the world is divided into countries and countries into cities, people developed their own culture and personalities. People became different and being different, most often than not, is the root of the problems in our world. Stereotyping a person is giving them a fixed perception based on their gender, race, or for other reasons. For my blog today, I will be writing about stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is when a person is in a situation wherein he or she is in the risk of confirming into typical negative stereotypes.

Being a Filipino and growing up in my home country, I never really felt any stereotype threat until I moved to America. I graduated from a great school in the Philippines, Ateneo de Manila University. If you are Filipino, you have probably heard the school name before. If you aren’t, you must be thinking “ok, great for you, but I haven’t heard of it, so it doesn’t really matter.” The phrase that I just said could be a reality if you really said it in your head or I could also be suffering from stereotype threat.

I first felt this way when I started applying for jobs and I was attending group interviews. I first applied as a personal banker for Wells Fargo and I was called for a group interview and there were 4 to 5 other people with me. All of them graduated from schools in the area but not really Ivy League schools or any top universities in the bay area like Berkeley or Stanford. At first, I was very confident with myself that I will get the job. When the interviewer started asking about our educational background, she kept on mentioning that she knew people from their schools and made compliments about their school. A connection was being established between the interviewer and the other applicants which was a bad thing for me. I suddenly became very nervous, I choked on my words, and I couldn’t organize my thoughts. I thought to myself “I just graduated from a 3rd world country so how can I be any better?” I became really insecure and I am sure I did not perform 100% during that interview. As an effect, I did not get the job.

If that happened to me, I wonder how others feel. There are so many negative stereotypes that are a whole lot worse than what I felt and that hopefully we could someday accept and look at other races and gender not as different but as equals so that someday, people do not have to be afraid or threatened of what other people might think of them.

In the tech industry, I am sure there is stereotyping since it is a high paying job and not all nationalities are trying to apply for a job in tech. It is a very good thing that boot camps are offering discounts for minority groups so that they can be motivated to take that leap of faith and try to break down the stereotype barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
In order to reduce the feeling of being insecure of stereotypes, you simply have to break that stereotype barrier and prove people wrong about their possible negative impressions about you. You have to be confident and set your mind not to be that stereotype. At the same time, make sure you are not putting on stereotypes as well.

To everybody reading my blog, I invite you to be great and feel great.
