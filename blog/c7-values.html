  <h1>Stop Stereotype Threat</h1>

  <section>
  <h2>Learning from Experiences is First Hand Knowledge</h2>
  <h4>July 30, 2015</h4>
    <p>
    Here are values I think of during my proudest and happiest moments: Accomplishment, Affection, Confidence, Enthusiasm, Excellence, Excitement, Inspiration, Personal development, and Will-power.
    </p>
    <p>
   In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
   (Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree)<br>
   Accomplishment - 5<br>
   Affection - 3<br>
   Confidence -4<br>
   Enthusiasm - 3<br>
   Excellence - 3<br>
   Excitement - 4<br>
   Inspiration - 4<br>
   Personal development - 5<br>
   Will-power – 2<br>
    </p>
    <p>
   In my opinion, the value that I find most important is personal development. Personal development is a lifelong process, wherein we develop all our skills (physical, mental, emotional, and other skills) to be the best version of ourselves possible. I try to see every experience as part of my personal development, even failure. Failure, can make us better people because we learn from our failures. When we fail, we strive not to fail at it again and succeed the next time around.
    </p>
    <p>
    Last topic I gave advice on was about careers. A close friend of mine hated her job. She hated her job even though it paid well. It made her days longer and her nights shorter. There were even times that she felt like crying because she was so miserable about being stuck at her job. She couldn’t just quit like any other person, because the major she took was for that industry and she has bills to pay like all of us. I told her that staying at her job for a while will develop her patience in doing boring tasks and also her grit so that she will become more motivated and passionate in learning something new so that she can get a job that she is interested in. Once she gets that new job she likes, she’ll be more patient with it when repetitive tasks come again.
    </p>
    <p>
    With every experience, whether it is something you hated, always remember you became wiser after that experience.
    </p>
    <p>
    When I look at every experience is for my personal development, I feel better. When it is an accomplishment, I have that feeling of success and knowing I became wiser. When it is a failure, of course, I’ll be sad about it, but I always look at it in the positive way that at least now I know what to do next time in order to succeed.
    </p>
    <p>
    I think that if you value personal development it will help in mediating stereotype threat because at least that way you will not be afraid whenever you feel it. If you do feel it, you will tell yourself that this is an experience that will make you better and stronger as a person. So that next time you are put in that situation again, you know what to do. With more experience, the wiser you get. Sooner or later, you might not even feel stereotype threats anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
    Whenever I feel down or feel that I have failed at something I wanted to accomplish, I always read failures of famous people. It makes me feel better and secure that my failure is a step to success. There are many examples of these. I do suggest researching on the failures of Albert Einstein, Michael Jordan, Walt Disney, and Steve Jobs. These are only a few people that I get a lot of inspiration from when I fail. These people are the best at what they did but their road to success was not perfect. Just like ours, our road to being successful is not rooted in the next few months. If you fall, learn to pick yourself up, strive to do better, and destroy that stereotype barrier.
