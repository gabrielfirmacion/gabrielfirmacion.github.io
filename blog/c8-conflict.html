  <h2>Learning from Experience</h2>

    <p>
In my previous line of work I was a customer service agent for a drug manufacturing company. The drug that I handled was sold to people with an average age of 80. Everyday, patients call me to activate coupon codes that they got from the doctor’s office to receive a free 30-day supply of our medication.
    </p>
    <p>
There was this one time a patient called me and his coupon was no longer valid and could not be activated in our system. I offered to exchange his coupon over the phone and requested that the patient get a pen and paper to write the code I was going to provide him with. However, the patient became very upset and started shouting. He even dropped the f-bomb on me. Once I heard that, I just hung up on him and did not even think.

    </p>
    <p>
My immediate emotion was I became really irritated and felt disrespected when I was trying to help him. After a while, my emotion turned into hate because I just simply hated my job. I felt like a martyr with my work, serving patients who cannot appreciate.

    </p>
    <p>
This was just one of my bad experiences being in a customer service role. Everyday, I woke up going to work and I detested it because I did not want to pick up another phone call and possibly get shouted at if their coupons do not work. In order for me to have a better perspective on my job, I just prayed and talked to my parents. They told me that what I was doing had a purpose. I was helping people in need that even though it seems that patients do not appreciate it, I was actually making their lives a little better. I empathize with them as well, patients who call are already old and very sick. They are the ones who call because they do not have someone to call for them which  was sad and I felt bad for them.
    </p>
    <p>
My perspective changed and it became a whole lot better. It still wasn’t a dream job but there was  a purpose why I was doing that job which made it meaningful.

    </p>
    <p>
If I could go back in time, I would probably have not hung up on the old man who dropped the f-bomb even though we are not suppose to tolerate that kind of language over the phone. What I should have done was listen, let him vent, and to remember that he is most probably just upset about his condition. After awhile he will most probably calm down and then that is the time I can talk the solution with him regarding his coupon.
    </p>
    <p>
My conflict started because of another person and then became an inner/self conflict. With my experience, I learned a lot about patience and having a purpose in life. Also, having people like my parents who already experienced a lot of things in life helped a lot. So remember when you have that conflict, approach someone with experience, you’ll be surprised of how they will be able to help you out.
