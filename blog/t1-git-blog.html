  <h1>My Version of Git, I Hope You Git It</h1>
  <h2>Git what I mean?</h2>
  <h4>June 13, 2015</h4>

        Git is a software for programmers that enable them (hopefully 'us' in the future) to store their code like checkpoints in a game. The system that git uses in order to do that is called 'Version Control'. Version control allows the programmer to store different versions of their files of code so that the programmer can choose what version he can use. Think of it as you are playing a Final Fantasy game wherein you go from chapter 1 to chapter 2 of the game, it will ask you to save your progress in save file slot 1. However, during the course of playing chapter 2, you want to change something you did in the beginning so you go back to the saved file, make changes in your game and then save it into save file slot 2 so that you can always go back to slot 1 incase you want to make further changes.

        Now how does Git do this? Git makes a snapshot of your file whenever you choose to save ("commit" in coding terms) your work. Unlike normal Word documents wherein you can save two exact documents, Git will only save another file when it sees that there is something different or changes were made. Whenever you want to look at all the files that were saved for a certain program, Git has a log (you type: Git Log) and you will see all the files that were saved with each file containing an explanation of the changes that were made so that you can easily choose the version you want to edit.

        Let's go back to the game Final Fantasy, whenever you save that particular chapter you are in, you only save it on your very own Playstation. However, with the most recent  Playstation, the Playstation 4 allows you to upload your saved game to the Playstation network so that you can play your saved game in your friend's house without having to bring your own console. Github is the playstation network for Git. Because of Github, you can store all your files into the internet so that you can always edit them from another person's computer. Also, Github allows people to share their work with other people without affecting your own work. Your friend can edit the code you made and save it to his own Github account so that yours won't be overwritten. Most importantly, you will not have to worry about losing years of work when a thief runs away with your laptop (knock on wood).

        There is Git and I hope you really Git it but in order to Git Git, you just have to Git. Git it?
