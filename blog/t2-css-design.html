  <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1>
  <h4>June 17, 2015</h4>

    <p>
        With CSS positioning there are 4 types of positioning you will encounter. The 4 types are Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed. Static is the default position meaning it will just go where it was told to go or where it would normally go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Relative is a little harder to explain. If you imagine a box that had a position static and its position was at the very center of the screen, and then you change the positioning to relative, the box will move in relative to where it was standing or where it was originally positioned. As you can see in the first two pictures below,margin-left is on 0px and was changed to 200px as shown in the next two pictures. The blue box just moved to the right in relation to the red box.
    <table>
        <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Relative%20Before%20Code.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Relative%20Before.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Relative%20Code%20After.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Relative%20After.png?raw=true"/></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Absolute positioning is where the position is in relation to the parent element beside it. It will be positioned in relation to HTML if there is no parent element beside it. If you did "right: 10px;" on a box that has an absolute position, it will will move 10 px to the right of the element beside it. As you can see on the first two pictures below, the red box is set at margin-left 0px and was changed to 200px as shown on the next two pictures.The blue box moved together with the red box because the position is absolute.
    <table>
        <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Code%20Absolute%20Before.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Absolute%20Before.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Code%20Absolute%20After.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Absolute%20After.png?raw=true"/></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, Fixed Positioning is where you are gluing that particular element to the screen so that even though you scroll to the right, left, or down, you will still see it at the exact same position of your screen. As you can see on the pictures below, I scrolled down as shown on the right most picture and the blue box did not change its position on the screen because the position is fixed.
    <table>
        <tr>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Code%20Fixed%20Before.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Fixed%20Before.png?raw=true"/></td>
        <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/Fixed%20After.png?raw=true"/></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
