  <h1>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h1>
  <h4>June 17, 2015</h4>

    <p>
        With CSS positioning there are 4 types of positioning you will encounter. The 4 types are Static, Relative, Absolute, and Fixed. Static is the default position meaning it will just go where it was told to go or where it would normally go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Relative is a little harder to explain. If you imagine a box that had a position static and its position was at the very center of the screen, and then you change the positioning to relative, the box will move in relative to where it was standing or where it was originally positioned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Absolute positioning is where the position is in relation to the parent element beside it. It will be positioned in relation to HTML if there is no parent element beside it. If you did "right: 10px;" on a box that has an absolute position, it will will move 10 px to the right of the element beside it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lastly, Fixed Positioning is where you are gluing that particular element to the screen so that even though you scroll to the right, left, or down, you will still see it at the exact same position of your screen.
