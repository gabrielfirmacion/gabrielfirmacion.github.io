    <p>
      Map is used whenever you want to iterate each object in an array and change it permanently given the block you made. What do I mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: you have a given array [1,2,3] and you want to multiply each object in the array by 2 and return a new array with all 3 objects multiplied by 2. [1,2,3].map { |n| n*2} will return a new array of [2,4,6].
    </p>
    <p>
      So what is the difference between ‘each’ and ‘map’? Both iterates each object and runs the block for each value. However, ‘each’ does not  change the return value and it will return the original object it was called on. Map, on the other hand, will change it to a new array permanently. Here is an image to show the difference:

      </tr>
    </p>
