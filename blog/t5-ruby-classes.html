      For this blog, I made a simple game of your all time favorite childhood games, "rock,paper, and scissors." I will explain how I used a class the game that I made.
    </p>
    <p>
      You use a class every time you want to create multiple methods that you want to call on each other. First, I will show you the game I made.
      <img class="game" src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/rockpaperscissors.png?raw=true"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost every class needs to start with the method initialize(line 2) which takes an argument from the player. I made 'choice', my instance variable which is why it has '@' before it (line 3). You make an instance variable every time you want your variable to be called from more than 1 method inside your class. If I did not make 'choice' an instance variable, I will not be able to call it from my 'check' method.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can see from my 'check' method (lines 6 to 21). I called the instance variable 'choice' a lot of times. That instance variable will determine whether or not you won the game.

    </p>
    <p>
      So every time you want to start your class. You have to call it by Classname.new(argument). Normally you set it to a variable so that it is easier to call the code with a method just like with what I did in lines 26 to 27.
    </p>
    <p>
      So lets try to play it 3 times. Here are the results.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/1st%20game.png?raw=true"/>
          </td>
          <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/2nd%20game.png?raw=true"/>
          </td>
          <td><img src="https://github.com/gabrielfirmacion/gabrielfirmacion.github.io/blob/master/imgs/3rd%20game.png?raw=true"/>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I guess I lost, I really sucked at playing this game even though chances are equal. Until next time, readers!
