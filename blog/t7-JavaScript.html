  <h1>Ruby Classes VS JavaScript Objects</h1>


  <section>
  <h4>What is the difference?</h4>
    <p>
Ruby hashes and JavaScripts Objects have the same concept and they look very similar as seen below.<br><br>
JavaScript Object<br>
var car = {<br>
___type:"Fiat",<br>
___model:500,<br>
___color:"white"<br>
};<br><br>
Ruby Hash<br>
car = {<br>
___“type” => “Fiat”,<br>
___“model” => 500,<br>
___“color” => “white”,<br>
}<br>
    </p>
    <p>
They both have name-value pairs. In Ruby, the pairs are called “key-value” pairs while in JavaScript these are called “properties.” If you want the value of “Fiat” to appear, in Ruby, you will type <i>car[“type”] #”Fiat”</i>. While in JavaScript you can call it the same in Ruby or by typing <i>car.type</i>; // “Fiat”.
    </p>
    <p>
In Javascript you can add properties by just doing the following: <i>car.size = “small”</i>;
In Ruby you can add key-value pairs by typing <i>car[“size”] = “small”</i>
    </p>
    <p>
As you can see, they are very similar in terms of they look and their use. However, syntax is still different. If you mix them up accidentally they will not work.
    </p>

There are still a lot to learn about the 2 languages so watch out for my future blogs!
