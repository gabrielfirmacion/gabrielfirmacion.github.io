  <h1>What is Rails?</h1>

    <p>
To those who are asking if Ruby and Rails are the same, they are not but the two are related. Ruby is the programming language and then Rails is the software that uses the Ruby language. Rails is created by David Heinemeier Hansson. He gave it the name “Ruby on Rails” but people thought it was too long so people just refer to it as “Rails.”
    </p>
    <p>
Rails is a web application development framework and is designed to making web apps easier to create. It is a package library that is installed and it is also a framework for building websites. Rails allows you to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create more complex websites. The rails software makes assumptions for the programmer so that the programmer will write less code. Experienced programmers even said that using Rails makes their jobs more fun.
    </p>
    <p>
There are 2 major guiding principles in using rails. First is “Don’t Repeat Yourself” or in short “DRY”. You may have already heard or read about this when you were studying a programming language. “DRY” is described as “Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system." Being “DRY” means that the code must not be repetitive and is maintainable. Second is “Convention over Configuration.” Rails gives you opinions on the best way to do a lot of code and it defaults to these conventions. With this, you will be able to save a lot of time in specifying what you wanted the program to do.
    </p>
    <p>
You must also be wondering if you need to study Ruby before studying or using Rails. Technically no, however it is advised that you should study Ruby first so that it will be easier for you to understand Rails. If you decided to dive into Rails right away, that is not a problem as well since you will be learning Ruby as you progress in your learning with Rails. However, knowing the syntax of Ruby will enable you to understand Rails easier and make your learning quicker.
    </p>
    <p>
So now it is clearer why it is called “Ruby on Rails” and Rails is not a programming language but a software. If you want to read more on Rails, I advise that you refer to this link: <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html">http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html</a>
